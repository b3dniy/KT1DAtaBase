# KT1DAtaBase

## Overview

This project sets up a database environment using Docker Compose. The configuration includes settings for environment variables and Docker services, allowing for easy setup and management of the database.

## Files

- `.env`: Environment file containing configuration variables.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file to set up the database services.

## Repository

[GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/b3dniy/KT1DAtaBase)

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b3dniy/KT1DAtaBase.git
cd KT1DAtaBase
```

2. Create and configure the `.env` file:

Ensure the `.env` file contains the necessary environment variables for your setup. Here is an example of what the `.env` file might look like:

```ini
# .env file
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=database
```

3. Customize the `docker-compose.yml` if necessary. This file defines the services, networks, and volumes required for the database setup. Here is an example snippet from the file:

```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: kt1database
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${DB_NAME}
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
```

### Running the Database

1. Start the Docker services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the database service in the background.

2. To stop the services, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Accessing the Database

You can access the database using any PostgreSQL client with the connection details provided in the `.env` file. For example:

```bash
psql -h localhost -U user -d database
```

## Details

### .env

This file contains environment variables that are used to configure the database service. Ensure you set the correct values for your environment.

### docker-compose.yml

This file defines the Docker services, including the database service. It uses the environment variables from the `.env` file to configure the PostgreSQL database.

## Example Output

After running `docker-compose up -d`, you should see output indicating that the services have started successfully. You can verify this by checking the running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```
